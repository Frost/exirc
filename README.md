# exirc

ExIRC is a IRC client library for Elixir projects. It aims to have a clear, well
documented API, with the minimal amount of code necessary to allow you to connect and
communicate with IRC servers effectively. It aims to implement the full RFC2812 protocol,
and relevant parts of RFC1459.

## Why?

I had need of this in another project of mine, and found that there were no good libraries available, 
documentation was always missing, it wasn't clear how to use, and in general were not easy to work
with.

## Status

Just getting started, but I have most everything I need. I plan to have the basics implemented sometime
in the next week.
